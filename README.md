# Template App Migration Dojo Cookbook Site

This is a [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) site. It is driven by markdown files that can be generated using the commands provided in this document.

# What makes a good recipe cookbook
0. **Make it customer agnostic.** No customer or customer project names in the recipes. Do not name recipe files with customer or customer project names.
2. Start from this repository
 https://github.com/pivotalservices/modernization-cookbook-template
3. Prefer `markdown` over `asciidoc`. Definitely don't write recipes in doc or docx.
4. Use TOML instead of `JSON` or `YAML` in the frontmatter.
4. Categorize your recipe from one of the following by adding one of the categories in the taxonomy below this in the front-matter markup like `taxonomy = ["API-FIRST"]`
5. Put all markdown files in the `content/recipes` and `content/documents`
6. Put good camel case title in `title=xxx` front matter to be automatically picked up by landing pages
7. Add `taxonomy=["CLIENT"]` to exclude the rendering of the recipe/doc or add `review_status = ["DONE"]` to get it published externally.
8. If in doubt look at the recipes in this template repo.

## Getting Started

### Initial Setup

- Install `hugo`
  - With homebrew (Mac): `brew update && brew install hugo`
  - Manual download and install: https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases

### Initial Setup of New Customer Cookbook
The following steps will walk you through the process of creating a new GitHub repository with the modernization template and wipe out all the commit history associated to the modernization template so you can start fresh in your new cookbook repository.

1. Create a new private GitHub repository in `pivotalservices` with the name of the customer with cookbook suffix ex. `customer-cookbook`

1. Download the `new-cookbook` script from [here](https://github.com/pivotalservices/modernization-cookbook-template/releases/download/new-cookbook/new-cookbook)

1. Run the script providing name of the customer cookbook and path to the cookbook repository 
`new-cookbook customer-cookbook https://github.com/pivotalservices/customer-cookbook.git`

1. Update the README and clean up existing content as needed

1. Add the new cookbook repository to `app[0]` team on the Github so that it is picked up by the cookbook aggregation tool

### Run locally (default: `localhost:1313`)
```
./localserver
```

### Publish Instructions
```
./publish
cf push
```

### Add New Recipe
```
hugo new recipes/(title).md
```

## Updating the theme

This site uses the `hugo-theme-docdock` theme, which is stored as a git submodule
under the `themes` directory.

To pull the latest version of the theme, update your submodules: `git submodule update --remote` and commit the change to customer cookbook repo.

## Disable Home Page Icon
To disable the homepage and remove icon from sidebar, set the `noHomeIcon` param in `/config.toml`:

``` toml
[params]
noHomeIcon = false
```

## Redirect to Different URL
To redirect to the `/recipes` route by default, uncomment the following in `/layouts/partials/index.html`:
``` html
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url=/recipes" />
```
