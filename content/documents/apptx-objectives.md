## Overview

The intent of this document is outline perhaps an alternative view into the objectives that an APpTx engagement attempts to achieve.  The goal being to begin to formulate a message in terms that would help with long term enablement of client development teams.

In order to achieve long term enablement, an organization's culture must also be enabled to an extent to allow enabled development teams to thrive.  On an engagement a product owner stated that he had no idea how he could run a business where teams were utilizing the "Pivotal Process".

Enabling development teams is less likely to be successful unless those who are managing those teams are also enabled.  With those goals in mind, AppTx engagements could be describes with following threree objectives.

1. Culture Transformation
1. Path to Production Definition
1. Design & Architecture Modernization

## Culture Transformation

### Agile Methodologies
- Team collaboration
- Iterative development and frequent feedback loops
- Frequent planning, daily updates, and retrospectives

### Project Planning
- Minimal Upfront Requirement Definitions
- Minimal Upfront Application Design
- Project Estimations Driven by Velocity

## Path To Production

- Establishing Application Standards for Production
- Automation of All the Things
  - Build and Deployment Pipelines
  - Testing (TDD)

## Design & Architecture Modernization

- Domain Driven Design (DDD)
- Event Driven Microservices
- Test Driven Development (TDD)
- Coding Principles
  1. [SOLID](https://springframework.guru/principles-of-object-oriented-design/)
  1. [***L***aw of ***D***emeter](http://wiki.c2.com/?LawOfDemeter)
- Design Documentation (Cookbooks)

## Organization Enablement

### Project Execution

The following image illustrates the differences in execution between projects implemented using traditional processes and Agile methodologies.  This image reflects the potential timeline differences for projects delivering new applications beginning at inception.  This image would more than likely vary greatly for projects involving enhancing existing applications.

This diagram is an example where development gave an estimate of two weeks to implement a given project. There is a tendency that when development estimates two weeks to implement a project that they will take closer to four weeks when given that amount of time.  The above diagram though shows that for this example that the development of the project was completed in two weeks.

#### Traditional Process Characteristics
- Large upfront planning and design.
- Projects are initially estimated (by development and QA) which are then padded to protect against uncertainties.
- Projects structured with Dev Code Complete and QA Test Complete milestones.
- Coding and Testing generally complete prior to milestone dates where features remain dormant.

#### Pivotal Process Characteristics

During one engagement, the client stated that Pivotal was engaged because of our reputation for being able to develop new features far quicker than developers using more traditional methodologies. The above diagram attempts to show how that is misleading to certain extent.  


### Organization Participation
- Enable Teams to Utilize the Pivotal(Agile/Lean) Process
- Enable Organization to Develop a Culture that Allows Process Utilization Growth

The diagram below outlines a typical client's organization chart.  Given the three objectives outlined above, the below diagram loosely identifies which levels of an organization would be involved with these objectives.

## Conclusions
- A successful AppTx engagement must not only entail developer enablement, but also entail establishing an organizational culture where that enablement can thrive.
- Stakeholders must have clear understanding of how to operate given how enabled development teams work.
