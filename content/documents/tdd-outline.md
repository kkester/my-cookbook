### Origins

+ [Test First](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/testfirst.html)
+ Testing Evolution

### Continuous Deployment

+ Defining Overall Testing Strategy
+ Path to Production
+ [Test Pyramid Specification](/documents/tdd-evolution)

### Unit Testing

+ [Defining the Unit](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/UnitTest.html)
+ Start with the Simplest Implementation that Works
+ Continuous Improvement (Refactor Constantly)
+ Test in Isolation

### TDD in Practice

+ TDD Refers to More than New Development
+ Determine Scenarios and Write the Test First
+ Execute the Test and Ensure it Fails
+ Implement the Code and Get the Tests Green
+ Refactor the Code and Re-run Tests
+ Write More Tests

### Frameworks, Tools, and Techniques

+ Assertions vs Code Coverage
+ Test for 10% of the Use Cases Used 90% of the Time
+ The Larger the Scope the More Valuable the Test
+ Limit Test Redundancy
+ Mockito
+ PowerMock
+ SpringBootTest
+ WireMock
+ Json Testing
+ Stream Testing
+ AssertJ Assertions
+ [Junit 5](https://junit.org/junit5/)
